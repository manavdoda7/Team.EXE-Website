                    Not always you can see past the veil of refined outputs. 
                    Sometimes everything has to be put in a package and delivered as the ultimate result. We do that. <br>
                    <span class="we-are">We are Team.EXE,</span> We are the departmental team representing the Computer Science and Engineering Department 
                    at the Annual Technical Extravaganza of NIT Hamirpur, Nimbus. Each year we strive to raise the bar for technical 
                    advancement and showcasing the best of Computer Science and Software Development for anyone to see. When it 
                    comes to projects, we take up projects that are helpful to the students and thus result in a smooth life for 
                    the students in the college; and we finish them using a corporate protocol of deadlines and online version control. 
                    Not only this, we organize many events on the actual three days of Nimbus, which are aimed to provide a fun-filled but 
                    still quite informative experience of what Computer Science has to offer. These events range from an online 
                    competitive coding competition to an offline debugging race, and a gaming competition too. The members of the team 
                    work equally hard to be able to brandish the projects as something theyâ€™ve contributed to as well as to be a source 
                    of unforgettable memories on the Nimbus through the onsite events. The team also gives any of the students that 
                    want to display any or all of their projects an opportunity to present their ideas and applications through 
                    the portal of Team .EXE, along with any guidance if required. Also, we aim to provide the freshers an outlook 
                    onto the world of programming and conduct many pre-nimbus workshops and classes for the first year, most recurrently 
                    Linux installation and command line.
